# FedDance
This repository contains scripts and instructions of running FedDance, a efficient and intelligent participant selection framework for federated learning in highly dynamic environments. FedDance systematically models a deviceâ€™s dynamic availability, data heterogeneity, and quantifies its diminishing returns in training accuracy throughout dynamic training, thereby sustaining the overall vitality.

FedDance is built upon [FedScale](https://fedscale.ai/), which offers a wide range of datasets and benchmarks for FL training and evaluation, covering various typical FL tasks like image classification, audio recognition.
